Install MQTT tools:
 
sudo apt install mosquitto mosquitto-clients
DEMO STEPS (for MQTT attack):
Start the MQTT server (IoT hub):
 
mosquitto
This acts like an IoT base station.
 
Open another terminal: Simulate a device sending data:
 
mosquitto_pub -t "home/temperature" -m "24°C"
Open a third terminal: Spy on all data (attack):
 
mosquitto_sub -t "#" -v
You’ll see the message:
home/temperature 24°C
 
Now pretend to be a fake device and send wrong info:
 
mosquitto_pub -t "home/temperature" -m "100°C"
You just injected fake data — that’s an IoT attack.
